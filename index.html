    <h2>WEB</h2>
    <p>
        The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system enabling information 
        to be shared over the Internet through simplified ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT "specialists" 
        and hobbyists, as well as documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet according to 
        specific rules, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

    <p>
        Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain name make up a website. 
        A single web server may provide multiple websites, while some websites, especially the most popular 
        ones, may be provided by multiple servers. 
        Website content is provided by a myriad of companies, organizations, government agencies, 
        and individual users; and comprises an enormous amount of educational, entertainment, commercial, 
        and government information.
